# IlDesertoDeiBarbari_WebApp
Il-Deserto-dei-Barbari is a web application which exploits gamification techniques in order to teach Javascript to users.

PHP and Javascript are used as back end and front end respectively.
We suggest to use XAMPP to run the web application. 
Moreover it is needed to download the codemirror (https://codemirror.net/) plugin before running.
